          Hey, I am Alhouseny Camara, I am currently a Junior attending Lehman College, I am a computer Science major. Looking to specialize in the mobile development field and eventually moving into augmented/virtual reality development. My expected graduation date will be in May 2022 and I  look forward to working and learning alongside you.

        <h2 class ="questions">What Interests me most about Tech?</h2>
        <p class="p-3">
          The most interesting thing about technology in my opinion is having the ability to take an concept that has developed in your mind and bring it into physical reality.  That concept also has the potential to impact and change so many lives. Technology also doesn’t stop there, it augments and amplifies our everyday lives. Our phones would be the perfect representation of this.

        <h2 class ="questions">My most recent project and the challenge I had to overcome? </h2>
        <p class="p-4">
          My most recent project would be a school project, in which we had to develop a web application for an Apartment complex. The Apartment complex wanted a scheduling system that would allow their tenants to register and reserve time slots in which they could go and use the laundromat. Due to  social distancing guidelines, The apartment complex wanted  each Tenant to only be allowed to use the laundromat once a week for a maximum of 3 hours. I was designated as the lead of the project, Which was a lot more challenging than expected. I tend to be a lot more reserved and to myself, but I had to break out of my shell and take on the responsibility. I created a group chat where we could keep ourselves updated on each other's progress. I made sure that we allocated times in which we could get on  Zoom and discuss any troubles that anyone in the group was having. Although I was out of my comfort zone, I still was able to persevere and lead my group to an amazing and finished project.

        <h2 class ="questions">A problem that I would like to solve with Technology</h2>
        <p class="p-5">
          A problem that I have been constantly dwelling on is the sustainability and scalability  of agriculture in Africa. I recently took a trip  to my home country(Guinea), and I visited a farm that my uncle owns. I could see how the lack of resources and technology was not allowing him to optimize production, and  if we look at the projected growth of Africa’s population, the amount of food that is being produced as of right now will not be able to feed the population that is oncoming. So with the help of new emerging technologies such as AI, farmers can be able to track and analyze their data and be able to maximize their production. I would like to be a part of the solution to help change this. I will be able to do this  through the development of an app that can make the user interface and experience understandable and easier to manage for farmers to be able to utilize.
